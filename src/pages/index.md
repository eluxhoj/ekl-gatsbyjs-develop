  title: What is CES?
  description: >-
    The consumer electronics show in Las Vegas is the largest meeting of tech
    vendors in the world. The meeting is always the first week of January each
    year and features the latest tech gear available.  There are many different
    levels of vendor booths at the show including a "Wild West" of tech
    offerings in one big hall. There is a display of the award winning tech for
    the year as well as huge booths from either Amazon or Google (depending on
    the year - they trade off showing each other up).

  CES is just an awesome place to go if you want to know what is happening in
  tech for that year, and a great way to detect tech trends. See what's hot and
  what is not.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
