  title: What is CES?
  description: >-
    The consumer electronics show in Las Vegas is the largest meeting of tech
    vendors in the world. The meeting is always the first week of January each
    year and features the latest tech gear available.  There are many different
    levels of vendor booths at the show including a "Wild West" of tech
    offerings in one big hall. There is a display of the award winning tech for
    the year as well as huge booths from either Amazon or Google (depending on
    the year - they trade off showing each other up).

  CES is just an awesome place to go if you want to know what is happening in
  tech for that year, and a great way to detect tech trends. See what's hot and
  what is not.

        What will 2020 hold for 3D printers? At CES 2019 there was a very nice
        display of 3D resin printers by Formlabs.  Which printer type will win
        out at CES2020 or has the market gone cold for the technology?

        What will we see in new drone tech at CES2020? At CES2019 there were a
        lot of drones to look at.  There were underwater drones made to look
        like sharks, dolphins and smaller creatures. There was a drone from
        Russia that charged it self while hovering in a designated area at its
        home base.  There was a huge people mover drone made by Bell Helicopter.
        There were individual drones that people could fly. They looked like
        motorcycles with propellers.

        Will we see more smarthome tech in 2020?  At CES2019 we saw lots of
        z-wave products, so many smart door locks that we couldn't keep track
        and even some security cameras with embedded AI.  We are excited to see
        if the smarthome segment continues to grow in 2020.

        CES2019 was loaded with car tech including some really fancy headlights
        by Audi, autonomous vehicle tech from pretty much all the manufacturers,
        some electric vehicle tech from the major players and more.  We are
        looking forward to seeing what CES2020 holds as car tech continues to
        advance.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
